# responsive-website-with-css-and-jq

The website has a welcome header and 4 other sections. To reach these sections you can scroll down or use the navigation above. The 'see my portfolio' button and contact-form are not active for obvious reasons. 

## Used techniques

* media-queries (Mobile First), tested for max. viewport width 1280px
* CSS keyframes-animations (header shake-button 'see my portfolio', arrow-button)
* jquery (interactive navigation on scroll and on click, arrow-button scrolls the page on mouseover to the second section)
